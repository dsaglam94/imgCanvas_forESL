## About Dawn and the project

I am a former teacher. The reason I started my code journey wasn't only because I love tech and coding but also I wanted to create something to help my students grasp the lessons better. 

Of course, there are many different options available on the internet for this problem, but mostly seperated. Therefore I wanted to put everything I need into the same place. 

> So this project came into life from this particular need.

It has a basic interface and not complicated as it was intended. 

User can :

- upload and see the image;
- draw on the image;
- clear or undo the drawings;
- roll a dice to decide the next move;

> 10.04.2022 added a new page that gives a random "Would you rather" question to the user.

## Accessibility 

- The page is fully accessible by "TAB" key and can be controlled by "arrow" keys
- Buttons have `aria-label` to explain what it does

### Tech stacks used 

- HTML
- SASS
- JavaScript

#### API used for random questions can be found from [this link](https://would-you-rather-api.abaanshanid.repl.co/home/)
