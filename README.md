## How it's made:
  <strong>Tech used:</strong> HTML5, SCSS, Vanilla JavaScript
  
  As a former teacher, I wanted to contribute to ESL teaching field. While I was teaching online, I liked playing games with students. It made lessons fun. One of the game types that we liked the most was ESL board game. I looked at the existing websites that allow users to upload an image and draw on it but they were way more complicated than for our purpose. Also another problem was to decide team's turns. We had to open different web app for this reason to roll a die, etc.
  
  So this project was made as an answer to this need. We used this site with many students and it worked perfectly. Since, I made this project earlier in my career, I had to return and made some optimizations for further use.

## Lessons learned:

I was using free public APIs for my questions section. At first it was working fine but then I figured that the APIs were broken. So I had to make some adjustments and changes. Also I learned to create my own API to avoid this problem and for better longevity. 

  
## My different projects:

Take a look at these couple of examples that I have in my portfolio:
